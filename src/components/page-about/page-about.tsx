            <p>Americans are hungry for democracy and are turning out in record numbers to vote. But that means long lines and sometimes empty stomachs.</p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, Pizza to the Polls is here to deliver the one thing that pairs perfectly with freedom: piping hot â€˜za. We take reports of long lines from folks around
              the country and then find local pizza places to deliver the goods.
